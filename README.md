## unsu.com - A Wallet Everyone Can Use.

## Motivation

In an era where the utilization of cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly convoluted, our solution is to simplify the process.

The crypto landscape is currently cluttered with an overwhelming array of options, exhaustive verification processes, and a proliferation of chains, coins, and exchanges, not to mention the ever-present risk of scams. 

Our project's goal is to cut through this noise, offering a streamlined, user-friendly platform that demystifies crypto transactions.

We envision a tool that empowers users globally to unlock and transact value simply with a secret phrase (s-phrase), accessible via any basic web browser on the simplest of devices. 

Our platform is designed to facilitate the sending and receiving of value with minimal steps, ensuring that even those new to crypto can engage with it effortlessly.

## Objective

Our primary aim is to democratize the use of cryptocurrency, making it accessible to a broader audience. 

We acknowledge the trade-offs between user-friendliness and security, especially given our focus on facilitating small, everyday transactions that typically involve faster, less costly, and potentially less secure methods. 

By eliminating unnecessary complexities and dependencies, we aspire to introduce a new wave of users to the crypto ecosystem, fostering a more inclusive and simplified experience.
